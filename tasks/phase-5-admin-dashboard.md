# Phase 5 — Admin Dashboard

**Goal:** A single page at `/admin` that shows everything needed to run Silly Goose Tales without touching Supabase directly. Built for a non-technical founder — plain English labels, color-coded warnings, no jargon.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 3 pipeline running. Stories generating and delivering.

## Prerequisite: Token Tracking (must ship before the cost panel)

- [ ] Add `input_tokens` (integer) and `output_tokens` (integer) columns to `sillytales_story_queue` — Supabase migration
- [ ] Update `generateStory` in `lib/story-generator.ts` to return `usage.input_tokens` and `usage.output_tokens` from the Anthropic response
- [ ] Update `app/api/generate-story/route.ts` to save those values when inserting into the queue
- [ ] Add `cost_usd` as a calculated value on read (Haiku 3.5: $0.80/M input, $4.00/M output) — compute in the API, don't store
- [ ] Also track QC scorer token usage (separate Haiku call) — add `qc_input_tokens` and `qc_output_tokens` columns

---

## Section 1 — Overview Strip (extend existing)

- [ ] Keep existing cards: Active subscribers, At-risk, Delivery success rate, Open rate, Queued, Flagged, Failures, Total
- [ ] Add: Free trial count (separate from active/paid)
- [ ] Add: Trial-to-paid conversion rate (paid ÷ total signups, as a %)
- [ ] Rename labels to plain English — e.g. "At risk (3+ unopened)" → "Disengaged — 3 stories ignored"
- [ ] Color logic: green = healthy, amber = watch, red = act now

---

## Section 2 — Cost Panel (new)

- [ ] Today's Claude API spend (sum of cost_usd for stories generated today)
- [ ] This week's spend (rolling 7 days)
- [ ] Projected monthly spend (weekly average × 4.3)
- [ ] Average cost per story (all-time)
- [ ] Total stories generated all-time
- [ ] Cost per active subscriber per month (total monthly ÷ active count)

---

## Section 3 — Per-Subscriber Table (new)

Each row = one subscriber. Columns:
- [ ] Child's name + age (from preferences)
- [ ] Status badge: Free Trial / Active / At Risk / Paused / Churned
- [ ] Stories sent (all-time count from delivery log)
- [ ] Total $ spent generating their stories (sum of cost_usd)
- [ ] Last story date
- [ ] Open rate (their stories opened ÷ delivered, as %)
- [ ] "Send story now" button — calls `/api/generate-story` + `/api/deliver-stories` for that subscriber immediately
- [ ] Sortable by: cost (most expensive first), stories sent, last active
- [ ] Color-code at-risk rows in amber

---

## Section 4 — Pipeline Status (new)

- [ ] Last time `queue-stories` cron ran + how many stories it queued
- [ ] Last time `deliver-stories` cron ran + how many it sent
- [ ] Stories currently sitting in queue with their scheduled delivery time (list, not just a count)
- [ ] Any stories with status `failed` or `flagged` — count + quick link to review
- [ ] Rate limit hits — how many generation attempts were blocked by the 23h rate limit

---

## Section 5 — Manual Controls (extend existing)

- [ ] "Run delivery now" button — hits `/api/deliver-stories` and shows result inline
- [ ] "Run story queue now" button — hits `/api/queue-stories`
- [ ] "Run health digest" button (already exists, keep it)
- [ ] Per-subscriber "Send story now" (lives in Section 3 table, but wire it up here)
- [ ] Buttons show a spinner while running and display success/fail inline — no page reload

---

## Section 6 — Revenue Panel (new, requires Lemon Squeezy data)

- [ ] Total revenue all-time (from Lemon Squeezy webhook data stored in Supabase)
- [ ] Active paid subscribers count + MRR
- [ ] Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- [ ] New paid subscribers this week
- [ ] Store Lemon Squeezy order data in `sillytales_orders` table — wire up in webhook handler if not already done

---

## Section 7 — Flagged Story Review (already exists, polish it)

- [ ] Keep existing flagged story cards
- [ ] Add "Regenerate now" button that fires immediately and updates the card inline
- [ ] Add "Approve anyway" button — marks as queued so it gets delivered as-is
- [ ] Show which QC checks failed in plain English (not raw key names)

---

## What to Skip (for now)

- Charts and graphs — not enough data yet, add post-launch
- Email open rate trends over time — revisit at 50+ subscribers
- CSV export — add when someone actually asks for it
- Story content search — overkill pre-launch

---

## Done When

You can open `/admin`, see at a glance if anything is broken, know exactly what the app is costing you per day, see every subscriber and their story history, and manually trigger a story for any user — all without opening Supabase or reading a single log.
